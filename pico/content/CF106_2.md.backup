# Year 106 Part 2 #

Last time we talked the king had just arrived of course that has kept us pretty busy as we've been needing to spruce up quite a few rooms to meet his demands.

More fancy items are always good! We’ll be giving some of the items to the nobles to keep them happy. Here’s a list of all our current artifacts we’ve got!

I feel like we're doing alright as a fortress we've got our king here and we're pretty well defended with our legendary Ax Dwarfs and our walled off cavern!

Sounds pretty spooky, although they’re in the cavern and we’ve got that walled off so we don’t have to worry about it. We’ve got to get our crossbow dwarfs actually training so we can deal with fire in the future without too much problem.

Right things with wings can just fly over walls…

So much for stuff not being a problem. That's what I get for paying attention to the video game awards over dwarf fortress. Very glad this overgrown trash panda decided to stop at the forge area instead of going straight up. Damage should be more limited here.

Summon the militia! I placed a station point halfway down the stairs to meet at so we get everyone together and rush the bandit all at once.
Our militia commander seems to hate wearing her armor and always takes it off so she takes forever to get ready. Also going to be the first test of our sword squad! Hopeful they don’t all die from us digging too deep.

The squad hadn't been fully assembled but the creature had started to head up the stairs so I just sent what guys we had gathered to cut it off before it got to the main base.

Turns out I didn't really need to wait for most of the squad the first ax dwarf that had arrived easily mopped him up as the weapon smith had already done a fair amount of damage to the creature/ it was already weakened.

None of our military suffered any wounds, the same can’t be said for our other dwarfs. I think we lost 4 dwarfs? Verifying that is difficult as raccoon breath can melt steel beams…I mean dwarf bodies. We’ll have to carve some memorial slabs for our dwarfren brethren that we can’t find the bodies for.

From the deceased the only bit we could find was the left foot of the furnace operator.

One of my favorite things about dwarf fortress is that even the enemies have a whole story about how they came to be at your base. In this case this beast had gotten into another fight with a different forgotten beast and still had it's blood splattered all over it.

The amount of damage we suffered as a result of this attack was quite minimal other then the loss of a few of our dwarfs due to the fact that it was the forge which was attacked. Only the wooden bins holding our bars were melted but the bars themselves were okay.

We’ve got to start making some more food! Each dwarf consumes ~2 food and ~4 drinks per season. So we’re good for another year or so but we don’t really want to be caught out. Going to clear some trees and then make a farm on the surface. Hopping to plant some oil producing seeds so we can get started on making soap. I’ve been having some problems with my dwarfs just standing around when I tell them to collect fruit but I think that’s because I haven’t gotten them any stepladders. So hopefully that will improve our food counts.

Turns out we lost a few more dwarfs we didn't know about. I'll contact the stone carver to start making some more slabs. On top of this we've also been having all of the children throwing tantrums, I'll get him to make some rock toys for the wee little bastards as well.

Recently some of the bards and other rando's that joined our fort have begun to apply for citizenship. One of them is a goblin who I decided to make a messenger for us. But the funny part is that he’s a legendary gelder ie he’s really good at chopping off dog balls.
Very weird. Speaking of which, one of my migrants brought another male dog that I did not get to right away. Hopefully not all of my dogs are pregnant now. Also he wants to fight so I’ll draft him into the military. He’ll join the Ax crew in case that leg gets the better of our injured dwarf.

Autumn's arrival brings us some uninvited guests. Time to call back everyone and bring out the military! We'll keep the goblin and the rest of the hammer bro's back as they need some more training before we wanna send them out in the field.

*An interesting thing to note is there is a human with the goblins. Sometimes children get snatched and then raised to join a different side in DF*

This battle ended up being a bit more bloody, turns out goblins can climb some walls? So they climbed into my livestock pen and messed up some animals.

Just when we thought we had finished off everyone I noticed there was a goblin running away. Poor gobbo had experienced trauma.

I would almost feel bad for the goblins as they really are just cogs in a giant war machine expect for they killed my dog.

We've been starting to get some interesting villagers.

Also you have *one* forgotten beast accident and all the migrants can do is gossip about how they're going to die.

Finally to end off the year we had our very first dwarf tantrum that actually did some damage. There's been a rowdy crew of "Monster Hunters" that just sit the the tavern and drink all day. A swordsdwarf got upset and started flipping tables so I ordered him expelled from the fort. Turns out he didn't like that very much and just started slicing up whichever dwarfs were closest. Of course the legendary "Ax the Snarls of Trade" squad made short work of him once they got there but he managed to do quite some damage before that.
