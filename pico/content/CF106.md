## Year 106 of CastleFurnace ##


Well this is certainly one way to start the year, the 1st of Granite brought us a siege in the form of a goblin invasion. Our sword dwarfs aren’t trained enough to deal with them and the crossbows haven’t figured out how to fire their weapons yet. We’ll have to leave it to the axe squad (Axe the Snarls of Trade) again. Hopefully our Militia Commander can take out some of her unhappiness on some goblin necks. If you don’t hear from me again, assume the worst…

*We cannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken the bridge and Second Hall. Frár and Lóni and Náli fell there bravely while the rest retreated to the Chamber of…Mazarbul. We are still ho{ldin}g...but hope …Óin's party went five days ago but today only four returned. The pool is up to the wall at West-gate. The Watcher in the Water took Óin--we cannot get out. The end comes soon. We hear drums, drums in the deep. They are coming.*

Just kidding yeah the Ax the Snarls of Trade slaughtered the goblins and didn’t even get a scratch. The Militia Commander was vicious in battle some highlights include biting a goblins arm and tearing it off as well as embedding her steel battle ax in an arm then proceeding to cut the goblin’s pancreas in half?! (Dwarf Fortress is Wild) I only hope her savagery does not turn on her fellow dwarfs.

### Aftermath ###
While evaluating our dwarfs for injuries our doctor noticed one of our ax dwarfs has an infected leg from an earlier attack. He’s been hiding it this whole time. The doctor is yelling at him saying what kind of fool doesn’t tell him something is infected and he hopes we never get zombies because we’ll all get turned before anyone tells him anything. The doctor also demands we make something called “soap” but making it seems more complicated than smithing so we’ll have to get our greatest minds on it.

Well hopefully we can have an uneventful year now so we can get some work done.

## Let's Do The Time Warp Again ##
Wait what?!? Why are we back to the beginning of the siege? Our Elders are saying we’ve gone through some kind of temporal anomaly called a “game crash”. Let's see how the siege plays out this time, maybe we can save those dogs… 

We’ll send in the ax guys far ahead of the dogs since they didn’t have a problem with them last time around. I expect our commander to lead the charge once again.
But it looks like one of the other ax squad members had a different idea.

*If you haven’t read dwarf fortress combat logs before you are welcome. Earlier in my fort I had a Dwarf child knock out a cyclops after it was grabbed.  Some people call dwarf fortress “not a game but a world simulator” which I think means that they’ve spent too long looking at ascii characters.*

We saved the dogs on the second go! That means we’ve now got 62 dogs! Our militia captain doesn’t appear to be possessed this time around? Hopefully we don’t encounter these temporal anomalies again, but if we do I won’t recount the discarded timeline anymore by not writing stuff until after things get saved or if something really great happens. We’ll keep a running counter though.

Just when we had finished rinsing the blood off after smashing those goblins, It was announced that an elvan caravan would be arriving. Among their goods contained a tiger which we obviously had to get. We traded them a bunch of rock crafts that oolo makes. Any dwarf can make crafts but oloo’s makes these wonderfully smooth rock earrings and necklacese. So we traded some of them for a few musical instruments for the drunk bards in the tavern to play. I don’t want to waste good metal on them. Next up we’ve got to decide where to put the tiger

Of course only after we were done trading they decided to spring this on me.

These pointy eared peeps will go to war over anything and I don’t really want to be fighting them and the goblins so I guess I better start counting how many trees we’re cutting down.
Of course with the elves comes their demands. We’ve been good on wood so far, hopefully our demand doesn’t go too high. They also increased our limit from 25 to 35.

Very excited to place this bed somewhere! We need to make a fancy bedroom for our baroness and this will fit right in.

### Let's Get Soapy ###

It’s soap time! Supposedly we can make lye from ash so it’s time to start burning some logs! Turns out we also need animal fat but my kitchen dwarf seems to love cooking with it so I’ve got to set some exclusions. But all the work orders are now set up and the infrastructure. We will have to request some more animal fat from the dwarfs this year.

We’ve been hard at work setting up our new hospital for our hard working doctors. A well has been set up and we only had some minor flooding. It’s more organized now, and we will add some decorations to increase the happiness of the dwarfs working there.

Speaking of needing to make fancy rooms for people, guess we gotta step up our game. Sorry baroness but that throne room is going to the king now. Definitely going to give that new fancy bed that was just made to the king. We’ve got quite a bit of work to do to get all these rooms ready, so we'll finish off this year with another update at another date!

Thanks for reading!
