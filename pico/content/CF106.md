## Year 106 of CastleFurnace ##


Well this is certainly one way to start the year, the 1st of Granite brought us a siege in the form of a goblin invasion. Our sword dwarfs aren’t trained enough to deal with them and the crossbows haven’t figured out how to fire their weapons yet. We’ll have to leave it to the axe squad (Axe the Snarls of Trade) again. Hopefully our Militia Commander can take out some of her unhappiness on some goblin necks. If you don’t hear from me again, assume the worst…

*We cannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken the bridge and Second Hall. Frár and Lóni and Náli fell there bravely while the rest retreated to the Chamber of…Mazarbul. We are still ho{ldin}g...but hope …Óin's party went five days ago but today only four returned. The pool is up to the wall at West-gate. The Watcher in the Water took Óin--we cannot get out. The end comes soon. We hear drums, drums in the deep. They are coming.*

Just kidding yeah the Ax the Snarls of Trade slaughtered the goblins and didn’t even get a scratch. The Militia Commander was vicious in battle some highlights include biting a goblins arm and tearing it off as well as embedding her steel battle ax in an arm then proceeding to cut the goblin’s pancreas in half?! (Dwarf Fortress is Wild) I only hope her savagery does not turn on her fellow dwarfs.
